  Spear Consultants specializes in "public funding" loans which offer lower rates and longer terms. We prepare comprehensive Feasibility Reports that outline present and future opportunities to determine financial viability for diverse projects including golf courses, community facilities, hospitality ventures, and more. Our independent approach adds credence and credibility to our clients' efforts, potential investors, and lenders.

  We assist clients with both conventional loans and public funding solutions. Public funding options are government-guaranteed loans that require no or limited equity from borrower(s). These are long-term loans (25 to 40 years) at low interest rates (prime + 1) and do not require personal guarantees. With a public funding loan, the government takes away personal guarantees from the lender and replaces it with a government guarantee up to 90%. Equity requirements are typically 20% of the loan, depending on which program is used.

  Our principal, Doug Spear, brings insights gained from 20 years at Wachovia Bank, offering an invaluable lender's perspective that strengthens our clients' funding applications.
