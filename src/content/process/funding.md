  The USDA guarantee loan program is complicated and confusing, but also can be flexible with different approaches. Our assignments are to complete a Feasibility Report to be shared with lenders, buyers or investors. This includes several visits to the projects and meetings with client, lenders, nonprofit, attorney and introduction to USDA. After an informal meeting, an Application is submitted to USDA area office, and they review reports / application, then forward to state office. One can expect USDA to ask questions and we will answer their questions and address their concerns. New owner's bylaws and local community support are important steps.

  Required reports are typically completed within two months including. Some clients may already have some of these reports, therefore, may not be necessary to complete a new one.
required_reports:
  - Feasibility Report
