confidentiality_note: |
  With each assignment I sign a Confidentially Agreement. While I do use project's name, I do not discuss financial aspects or status of our efforts with others. Clients do not want me to discuss their projects with outside parties. When meeting with others I do not speak for my client, but I do speak on their behalf. While responsible for my report, I cannot be responsible its use by others (lenders, government, investors).
