  Spear Consultants specializes in "public funding" loans which are lower rates and longer terms. 
  We prepare a Feasibility Report that outlines present and future opportunities to determine 
  financial viability for an existing or proposed golf course.
  
  Our independent approach adds credence and credibility to the client's efforts, potential investors, 
  and lenders. We assist clients with conventional loans and/or public funding.
